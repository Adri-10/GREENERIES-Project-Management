I'm starting a new business called "Greeneries" that focuses on delivering unique indoor and outdoor plants, flowers and gardening tools. We'll have a mobile application where you can easily find and buy your favorite plants. My goal is to show people how important plants are for our planet and our economy. 
‘Greeneries’ is an app where you can buy indoor and outdoor plants easily from sellers. You can also get help with planting. It's useful for plant lovers and sellers to connect and trade plants at fair prices. My project is made for commercial use. Many people in cities don't have access to plants from rural areas and rural farmers struggle to reach customers. Some Facebook pages sell plants, but they're not always trustworthy in price and quality. To fix this, we're introducing 'Greeneries' for plant enthusiasts, creating a reliable platform for buyers and sellers. Users can also get planting tips from our experts.
